This is an example of a PowerBi Dashboard. The first dashboard shows metric tons of recycled glass per year and, the comparison with 
the previous year. The second one shows kgs of recycled glass per habitants and, habitants per number of containers.

There are 5 csv files, from where we are getting the data. The data is uploaded to this repository, and can be downloaded directly to
Power BI. Using the ...method.

Before retrieving the data with Power BI, it has been necessary to make some modifications using the code XXX.py, to modify some
confidential data, as the values that originally came in the csv files where real. In both Entradas_18_19.csv and Entradas_20.csv the
columns 'MATRICULA' has been deleted and the data in the column 'CANTIDAD' has been modified with a simple algorithm.
